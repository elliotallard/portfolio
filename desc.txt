I love people, human-centered design, and computers. On this portfolio, some of my work in design, software development, and professional & technical writing is displayed. Some notable courses I have taken were in computer science, application and database design & development, and user-centered research. I am fascinated by what the technology of today is capable of, whether it be social media platforms, AI warehouse robots, or even facial recognition software. At the same, I am incredibly invested in the people and environment affected by these developments, whether it be economically, culturally, or psychologically. I believe that future generations of technology can be beautiful, and solve some of the world's toughest problems. But, I also believe that it can exacerbate these same problems, or create new ones. With that said, I want to be part of technology/experience generation with a focus on the people who would be using or affected by it. Our world needs it.
